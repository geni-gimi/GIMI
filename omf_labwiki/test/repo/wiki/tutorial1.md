title: Bounds on Wireless Links

# Hypothesis: Wiresless Links are bandwidth Constraints

We want to test the hypothesis that wireless links are bandwidth constraints.

## First Experiment

The first experiment we want to conduct is sending a flwo from one node to another connected
by a wireless link. We will successively increase the data rate of the flow and compare the outgoing
traffic on the sending node with the incoming traffic on the receiveing node. If there is a bandwidth
limit on the link we should observe a corresponding limit on the incoming traffic.

Here are the results of one such experiment:
